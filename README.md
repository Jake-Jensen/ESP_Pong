# ESP_Pong
A poorly written Pong clone display for the Heltec ESP32 WiFi Kit 32 V3.

# Why?
I just felt like making a neat display for my ESP when it's not in real use. 

# Problems / Issues
It doesn't take advantage of the super sleeping abilities of the ESP, but on a regular 350mah LiPo, lasts about 4 days continuous.
There's no way of actually playing yet. I do plan on adding support for either control sticks or potentiometers.
Depends on the Heltec (https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32) library, so no real Go display support. Regular SSD1306 should work with some tweaking.
The code is really sloppy ^.^
